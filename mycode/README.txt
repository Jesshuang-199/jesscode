Introduction for R code

We have written code for five classifier models in R, namely KNN, Naive Bayes, Perceptron, Random Forest, and SVM. We present the code in markdown format.

Upon opening the file, in the first code block, a list of R packages needed and the importation of the required data files is provided. Please execute the code in the first code block first, ensuring that the R packages and data files have installed and imported, before running the subsequent code.

For each classifier model, the code includes the initial steps of importing training data and fitting the model. It also involves training the model using ten-fold cross-validation, displaying relevant evaluation metrics from the confusion matrix and ROC curve, along with some data visualizations.
